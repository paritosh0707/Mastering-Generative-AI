# Text Summarizer

## Context of what to do
Basically we have to create a project in notebook itself for text summarizaation purposes.

## Libraries Overview

### Transformers
Transformers is a popular library for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, developed by Hugging Face. It provides pre-trained models and tools for fine-tuning them on specific tasks, such as text classification, translation, and question answering.

### Datasets
Datasets is a library for accessing and working with various datasets commonly used in machine learning and natural language processing tasks. It provides a unified interface for loading datasets in a variety of formats and preprocessing them for model training.

### SacreBLEU
SacreBLEU is a tool for evaluating the quality of machine translation outputs. It computes the BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) score, which is a widely used metric for assessing the accuracy of translations compared to reference translations.

### rouge_score
Rouge Score is a library for evaluating the quality of summaries or generated text. It computes various Rouge metrics (e.g., Rouge-1, Rouge-2, Rouge-L) that measure the overlap between generated text and reference summaries.

### py7zr
Py7zr is a Python library for working with 7z compressed archives. It provides functions for creating, extracting, and manipulating files within 7z archives, which are commonly used for compressing large datasets or files.
